## Database (or indexer)

**Requirements**
1. Scale - maintain similar performance with 10x - 100x more data
2. Performance - reasonable query time: say 100ms (based on HTTP response in 500ms+-100ms)
3. Cloud hosting (bonus) - a pre-existing could hosted database decreases operations costs and makes scaling easier
